Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters - Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. ~ Example 1: Input: s = "abcabcbb" Output: 3 Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Example 2: Input: s = "bbbbb" Output: 1 Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1. Example 3: Input: s = "pwwkew" Output: 3 Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring. ~ Constraints:  * 0 {$<$}= s.length {$<$}= 5 * 104  * s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.},
